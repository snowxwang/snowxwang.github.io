# about me

## Mar 2016 – present

I’m currently a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Jeff W. Lichtman in the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University. I work on large-scale connectomics using serial electron microscopy.

– I go to Zoe’s every day for their amazing lunch specials.

## Apr 2015 – Feb 2016

Travel. Travel. Travel.

– I went on a cross-country road trip with my mom in the summer of 2015. We drove from Boston to San Francisco and the way back (total mileage 5,500+ miles). It was unforgettable.

– I made several regional trips to western and southern China with my parents in the fall and winter of 2015. It was a great family reunion.

– I celebrated my thirtieth birthday at home with my best friends and families.

## Jan 2013 – Mar 2015

I did a transitional postdoctoral project with Dr. Brian Bacskai at Mass General Hospital / Harvard Medical School to develop a feasible high-throughput antibody screen assay that combines immunoprecipitation, in vitro/in vivo calcium imaging, and array tomography.

– I miss the people in the 114 building and (of course!) the Style Cafe.

## Aug 2008 – Dec 2012

I completed my doctoral dissertation in Dr. Christopher Del Negro‘s lab at the College of William and Mary by developing an automated system for single-cell laser ablation in neural circuits retained in slice preparations of brain tissue.

– Williamsburg is one of my favorite places in the world. I spent the best time of my life there.

## Sep 2004 – Jun 2008

I attended Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), a top engineering school in China, and dual majored in Biomedical Engineering (BME) and Computer Science (CS). I graduated with two B.Eng. degrees (with honors in CS) in 2008.

– In the summer of my junior year, I led a volunteer team into the AIDS villages in Henan, China. This trip changed the way I thought about the world.

– I wrote screenplays in my downtime and sold them to film producers. I also enjoyed  stock trading.

## Before Jun 2008

I attended the Middle School Attached to Northwestern Polytechnical University (西工大附中). I performed well in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Biology, but my favorite class in high school was Chinese Literature.

I won the first prize in the Chinese Biology Olympiad (CBO/CHSBO) and was admitted to college without taking the stressful National College Entrance Examination (NCEE; 高考).

I attended Daxue South Road Elementary School (大学南路小学) and spent much of my time solving mathematics olympiad (奥数) problems there. It was fun.

I started to learn sketching, painting, and calligraphy at the age of four. I was trained by two renowned Chinese painters Yancheng Wu (吴彦成) and Hong Shi (鸿石) for years.

I was born in Xi’an, one of the oldest ancient capitals of the world, which is the most famous landmark in central China often featured by its unique food cultures.
